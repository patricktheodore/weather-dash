# weather-dash
an intuitive weather forecast app using openweather api, moment api, bootstrap and jQuery. 

this weather app allows the user to search for a city and then the current weather is displayed along with a forecast for the next 5 days. 

previous searches persist in local storage and are displayed under the search bar

previous searches are clickable and will reload the weather forecast for that city. 

uv index icon changes with scaling severity of current uv index

icons change depending on weather forecast for the week 

the app has consistent stylings to my previous apps
